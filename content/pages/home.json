What can you do? Take a taxi or uber and collect your car the next day? What a waste of time and money…simply call North Shore’s Dial a Driver and a professional and experienced driver will come and drive you home in your own car.\n\n## **Coverage**\n\nOur service operates on the North Shore, Whangapararoa, West Auckland and central city.

We are based on the NORTH SHORE.\n\n## **Daytime service**\n\nWe can pick up from car auctions, day surgeries, hospitals & private clinics, schools or places of work due to illness or an accident on site.\n\nIf it is possible to pre book for a medical appointment in order to allow us to collect you, that is always the best approach – it allows us to be available when your ready to go home.\n\nOtherwise we will are able to help but you will need to be patient as we will be a little longer than usual to get to your address to collect you.\n\nThe prices are competitive, and far cheaper than getting a taxi both ways to your party or social event.\n\n## Prices\n\n* Up to 5km - $35 standard or $30 cash\n\n  Up to 7km - $41 standard or $35 cash \n\n  Up to 9km - $47 standard or $40 cash \n\n  Up to 11km - $53 standard or $50 cash\n\n  Up to 13km - $59 standard or $55 cash \n\n  Over 13km - Standard Rates\n\n## **Operating Hours**\n\n* We are open 7 Days a week 364 days a year\n* EXCLUDING Christmas day we are CLOSED for ONE day ONLY.\n* Weekend hours are 11am – 3am Friday & Saturday nights.
