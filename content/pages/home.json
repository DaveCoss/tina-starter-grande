What can you do? Take a taxi or uber and collect your car the next day? What a waste of time and money…simply call North Shore’s Dial a Driver and a professional and experienced driver will come and drive you home in your own car.\n\n## Our Service\n\nWe can pick up from car auctions, day surgeries, hospitals & private clinics, schools or places of work due to illness or an accident on site.\n\nIf it is possible to pre book for a medical appointment in order to allow us to collect you, that is always the best approach – it allows us to be available when your ready to go home.\n\nOtherwise we will are able to help but you will need to be patient as we will be a little longer than usual to get to your address to collect you.\n\nThe prices are competitive, and far cheaper than getting a taxi both ways to your party or social event.\n\n## **Coverage**\n\nOur service operates on the North Shore, Whangapararoa, West and central Auckland. We will collect you anywhere in the greater Auckland area and take you and your vehicle to any  Auckland destination.\n\n## **Operating Hours**\n\n* We are open every day except Christmas day\n* Friday and Saturday: 11am – 3am or later if required or booked.\n* Monday – Thursday: Hours vary but generally open up to 1.30am dependent on bookings we may have."
